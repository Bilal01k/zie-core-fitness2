                Zie Core Fitness was founded in 2024 in Ajman, Dubai, with a strong mission: to build a fitness community where everyone feels welcome, motivated, and empowered to lead a healthier life.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started as a well-equipped gym has rapidly grown into a modern fitness center featuring advanced facilities, professional trainers, and a vibrant community of members dedicated to their wellness journey.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even though we're at the beginning of our story, our passion for delivering exceptional fitness experiences drives everything we do — from diverse workout programs to a supportive environment that helps you become your best self.
